###To compile the server in windows with NVIDIA card###
- Install BOOST
  - http://www.boost.org/users/download/
  - I downloaded boost_1_60_0-msvc-10.0-32.exe from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost-binaries/1.60.0/ for Visual Studio 2010
- Install CMAKE, I took cmake-3.5.0-rc3-win32-x86.msi
  - http://www.cmake.org/install/
- Install Nvidia CUDA from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
- Open CMAKE
  - In the field: where is the source code, have the path to the subfolder Server from RPI-GPU-rdpClient git.
  - In the field: Where to build the binaries, make a subfolder build under Server
  - Press configure, I selected "Visual Studio 10 2010"
  - Click on Add Entry and enter BOOST_ROOT to the root of the Boost folder "C:/local/boost_1_60_0"
- Build, I used Visual Studio
- Optional, FFMPEG for a CPU fallback if the graphic card is unavailable
  - Download FFMPEG from http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/, need the dev and shared
    - Set FFMPEG_ROOT to the root of FFMPEG dev folder
    - Add the bin folder of the shared zip to your path, or copy the DLLs
